                        <p>REBYOTA has no identified contraindications.</p>
                        <p><strong class="accordion__subTitle">Warnings and Precautions</strong></p>
                        <p>No serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients treated with REBYOTA. Do
                            not use in patients with a previous hypersensitivity to REBYOTA or any of the product
                            components.</p>
                        <p><strong class="accordion__subTitle">Adverse Reactions</strong></p>
                        <p>The most common adverse reactions following blinded treatment with REBYOTA (reported by ≥5%
                            of all subjects and greater than placebo) were diarrhea and abdominal pain.</p>
                        <p><strong class="accordion__subTitle"> Interactions</strong></p>
                        <p>Since REBYOTA is not absorbed into the body, no metabolic drug-drug interactions are
                            expected.</p>

                        <p>Of the 749 patients treated with REBYOTA, 47.9% were ≥65 years of age, and 25.8% were ≥75
                            years of age. No overall differences in safety and efficacy were observed between these
                            subjects and younger subjects. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients ≥65 years of
                            age.</p>
